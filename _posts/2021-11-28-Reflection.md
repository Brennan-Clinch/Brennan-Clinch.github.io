# My Reflection
I have recently finished up a course at NC State University (ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians) and would like to reflect on some things.

-What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do

After taking this course, I feel like I've gotten to know a bit more about the field of data science along with getting a better idea as to what a data scientist might do
A few months ago, I made a post on what my views are of a data scientist are and what they do and how it differs from say a Statistician. After taking this course, I have learned 
that data scientist and Statistician are very similar things and can somewhat mean the exact same thing in that they both try to create models and methods that best describe the 
relationship between data that they want to make inference on. However, I have now learned that data scientists are more looking to build and use multiple ways(old ways and use of 
machine learning and other methods) to improve models that can show and predict future trends that a company may face rather than just building a model using statistical methods. 
However, with the trends today, it appears that they might be today's version of a Statistician since there is a lot more data out there now than there was like 20 years ago which 
requires a lot more advanced techniques and skills than that of an old school Statistician might have. So I do think that they almost mean the same thing although data science is 
more advanced and is just the modern job replacing most Statisticians here since I find there are very few Statistician jobs posted online and millions of Data Scientist jobs 
posted online.

-what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

Overall, I feel that R is a really great and easy tool to use for data science. It is an easy open source programming language to learn and use and has a lot of good packages that 
can be used for data science. I have had the most programming experience in R (2 years) since almost all my statistics classes I have taken during my undergraduate career as well
as my graduate career have used and required it. However, I feel that while I will still continue using R since I am most familiar with it, I might do data science using Python as 
well since one big con I have with R is that it can have slow processing speed since when I have downloaded large data sets and have ran machine learning methods on models, it has 
been very time consuming. And Python is a really great language for working with large data since it can handle many GB of data and have very fast processing speed and is also the 
#1 platform for data science today. So I feel that I will continue doing data science projects in R while also doing more using Python since I have decent understanding and 
experience with the language from a programming course I took using it during my undergraduate career. 

-what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
