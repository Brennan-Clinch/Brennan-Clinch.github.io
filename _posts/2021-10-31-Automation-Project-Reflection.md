I have completed a project that deals with automating reports using R Markdown along with getting practice with predictive modeling techniques. The link to the project is
[here](https://brennan-clinch.github.io/Project2/) and the link to the github repository is [here](https://github.com/Brennan-Clinch/Project2). 

For this project, me and [Allison Warhus](https://github.com/awarhus) worked on automation of R Markdown reports for EDA and predictive modeling. We used the [Online news popularity data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity) and automated different reports based on what data channel we are in.

With completion of the project, I would like to reflect.

1. What would you do differently?

 -Well, one thing that I might do differently would be to read more about merging/conflicts since I had trouble pulling/pushing with github and had to reset a couple of times having to redo some documents along with trying to know more parallel processing techniques to speed up some of the predictive modeling computations since it took so long (~1.5 hours to get all my reports automated on the first try). 
 
 -Maybe see if there would be a way to normalize some variables before doing EDA since this dataset wasn't the best with some EDA techniques that would have been really useful like creating scatter plots since all of the variables were really skewed right.

2. what was the most difficult part for you?

  -Well, one of the most difficult things was definitely figuring out the rendering and automation of the documents. Since we were using columns instead of rows and filtering them to equal 1 which is what they equal when it is in a certain data channel we had to take a different approach when automating the reports.
  
  -The other thing that was difficult and annoying was having to manually go into all the automated reports at the end and do summaries of EDA for all 6 md documents which was really tedious since each report had different plots and numbers for EDA.
  
3.  what are your big take-aways from this project?

-This project has really helped me learn how to automate reports using R Markdown efficiently along with get more practice with predictive modeling techniques. One big takeaway is that I need to learn about more ways I can really standardize my variables before doing EDA or predictive modeling since we had really low R-squared values in our modeling and really large RMSE values. I also need to know more ways that we could maybe automate EDA since it was incredibly tedious going in and doing summaries of plots for all 6 reports.
